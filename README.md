# Solarized Fox

Simple theme to make Firefox as soothing on the eyes as it is pleasing!

## Credits

* Significant inspiration from the [example dynamic extension](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/dynamic-theme) â€” a wonderful start to my first browser theme/extension

* The amazing [Solarized theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) by Ethan Schoonover. The icon graphic is also from there!

TODO: follow instructions for porting the theme
